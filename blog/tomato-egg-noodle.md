## ingredients

(makes 2-4 servings)
- 4 tomatoes
- 4 eggs
- olive oil
- salt, sugar
- corn starch

## preparation

- cut tomatoes
  - cut tomatoes in half down the middle
  - "V"-shaped cut to remove green parts but save as much flesh as possible
  - cut into fourths with evenly spaced vertical cuts
  - cut into eighths with a horizontal cut
- crack eggs into a container and beat

## cooking

- cook eggs first
  - oil in pan
  - preheat before putting eggs in (added drop of water should sizzle)
  - spread evenly initially
  - use chopsticks to pull into center, form sheets, let solidify, pull again
  - add salt
  - take eggs out
- cook tomatoes
  - put tomatoes in
  - add salt at the beginning to get water out (something about osmosis)
  - flatten tomatos with wooden spoon (to press out the liquid)
  - keep the lid on to prevent boil off,
    occasionally open and press again
  - let cook for a bit
  - add salt, sugar, one spoon of corn starch mixed in water
  - let cook
- add eggs, mix, done


## noodles

- follow the instructions on the package

Institutions I am affiliated with:
* 2021--present: [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/),
  B.S. in Computer Science
* 2017--2021: [TJHSST](https://user.tjhsst.edu/2021shuan/)

I like math, I like computer science, and I like anime. Some of my best work
have been in the intersection of the three. In particular, I am interested
in discrete & continuous optimization, game theory, information theory, and
statistical learning. My favorite genre of anime is, of course, cgdct.

The website's tagline "researching cgdct anime" comes from the following quote:
> My research is in applying convex gradient descent convergence theorems
> to adversarial networks imagining multimodal entropy (cgdct anime).

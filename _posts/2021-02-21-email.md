1. Use [PGP](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~adrian/630-f04/PGP-intro.html),
[arch linux guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG).
PGP allows for
    1. encryption: encode a message such that it can only be decoded by a
    certain person. This is accomplished by encrypting towards a person's
    _public key_, which they can then decode with their _private key_.

    2. signing: generate a digital signature that proves you are the author of
    a document (correspondingly, also that the document has not been modified).
    This is accomplished by encrypting with your _private key_, and therefore
    anyone can check the signature with your _public key_.

n.b.: the basis of encryption with PGP is something called RSA, which
is some math stuff with big primes and factorization being hard. Look
into it if you're interested, I haven't myself so I can't give insight.

n.b.: these features don't work unless you actually _use_ them!

2. Use [neomutt](https://neomutt.org/guide/intro)
(or [claws](https://www.claws-mail.org/)).

neomutt is a terminal mail user agent which allows you to check your
email in the terminal with a nice ncurses interface. It is a huge pain
to setup. However, typical email clients are essentially browsers, so
that they can render HTML/CSS/images, etc. This leaves them highly
vulnerable to backchannel attacks like
[EFAIL](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity18/sec18-poddebniak.pdf).

The gist is the following: suppose I have access to your encrypted emails,
through snooping your network, getting access to your filesystem, etc. EFAIL
has two insights into attacking email encryption, both of which rely on me
sending you the encrypted email and your email client decrypting the email
and automatically sending the plaintext contents back to me.
1. I simply take the ciphertext and directly put in information, e.g. a
html image tag that will encompass the ciphertext. When the browser loads
the email, it first decrypts all encrypted content. It then loads the
html and therefore tries to query the url I provided with the decrypted
content, which will give me the encrypted email.

2. I massage the ciphertext, taking advantage of the nice properties of xor:
`~a xor b = ~(a xor b)`. This allows me to encode arbitrary information into
the ciphertext, e.g. the same html image tag as before. This attack is more
sophisticated because for the first attack, the email client simply has to
separate the rendering of the different MIME parts to prevent one part from
affecting the others. The email client has no means of detecting this attack
because it appears to be (and is) valid ciphertext.

neomutt trivially removes most backchannels since it lives in terminal,
it cannot render HTML, CSS, SVG, or any traditional "web" formats. In
fact, is is only capable of rendering plaintext; viewing pdfs and other
attachments must be done with external software. One often views html
emails with [w3m](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/), for example. I think w3m
won't actually query links unless asked, but there remains the risk that
one clicks a very fishy link. To address this, neomutt also allows one to
separate the online, internet access elements of email from the viewing
of email since it can display from local files, so one can download their
email with something like [offlineimap](https://www.offlineimap.org/)
and turn off internet when viewing emails in neomutt. Note that this is
not foolproof, since the massaging of ciphertext allows it to decrypt to
nearly _arbitrary_ plaintext. If not isolated properly this could allow
an attacker to inject binary data to view files or to execute commands.
However, this process is clearly much more difficult than a browser.

3. **Don't** quote emails in replies!

Inline with the ciphertext manipulation above, it is possible to determine the
content of a ciphertext if one is able to _query_ the decryption of some other
ciphertext. In particular, an attacker can manipulate a ciphertext then send
the modified ciphertext to the victim. The ciphertext (when decrypted by the
victim's email client!) will look garbled, so the victim might reply, quoting
the original email (which is the default behavior of many email clients) with
some message like "what were you trying to say?" The attacker then gets the
decrypted modified ciphertext, which they can use to recover the plaintext of
the original ciphertext. This class of attacks are called
[_chosen ciphertext attacks_](https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-chotext.pdf)
since the attacker is able to _choose_ what ciphertext to decrypt.

Combining the ideas of the above paper and EFAIL, this
[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07550.pdf) shows how people can
unwittingly become decryption or signature oracles by replying to (and
copying the text of) malicious emails by hiding components with MIME,
HTML, or CSS. Suppose an attacker sends a seemingly innocuous email with
ciphertext hidden. The user loads the email in their email client which
decrypts the ciphertext, then when the user replies and copies the email
in the reply, they unwittingly send the plaintext in the quoted reply.
The same trick can be done to get people to sign arbitrary text.

4. **Always** include the name of the recipient in the email! 

Not only is this good etiquette, it fixes the problems with
[sign & encrypt](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/usenix01/full_papers/davis/davis.pdf).
By default, if asked to both sign and encrypt a message gpg
will sign _then_ encrypt (in that order). The attack is very
simple, suppose Alice signs and encrypts a message to Bob:
```
A -> B: encrypt(sign(msg, a), B)
```
Bob can then take this packet, decrypt it,
re-encrypt it to Charlie and send it to him:
```
decrypt(encrypt(sign(msg, a), B), b) = sign(msg, a) 
B -> C: encrypt(sign(msg, a), C)
```
It now appears Alice sent the message to Charlie directly!

This might seem unrealistic in the email context (shouldn't Charlie
notice that the email is from Bob, not Alice?), but it is easy to
[spoof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_spoofing) the `From:` header
since there is no checking of authenticity of email headers.

The simplest way to prevent this sort of _surreptitious forwarding_ attack is
to simply put the recipient in the message and then sign & encrypt as usual:
```
A -> B: encrypt(sign({Bob, msg}, a), B)
```
This prevents Bob from being able to send the message to Charlie convincingly.

5. Don't trust your eyes.

There are
[many](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19fall_muller_prepub.pdf)
ways to spoof. Obviously it is easier if the email client supports HTML,
but even mutt is not immune. Suppose I send the following plain text message:
```
[-- The following data is PGP/MIME encrypted --]

[-- Begin signature information --]
Good signature from: Stephen Huan <stephen03.huan@gmail.com>
                aka: Stephen Huan <2021shuan@tjhsst.edu>
            created: Wed Aug  2 22:07:55 2017
[-- End signature information --]

[-- The following data is signed --]

I have signed and encrypted this message!

[-- End of signed data --]

[-- End of PGP/MIME encrypted data --]
```
It looks like I signed and encrypted this message! Of course, if the user
checks the flags or has header colors enabled the jig is up --- but that
requires more care then just casually scanning the email (and, by default,
mutt does _not_ color anything). Even header colors can be spoofed if the
attacker knows what colors to use (dotfiles, anyone?) and encodes the colors
with ANSI escape sequences (which mutt will render).

6. Use full key ids, e.g. "EA6E27948C7DBF5D0DF085A10FBC2E3BA99DD60E"
instead of "A99DD60E". This one is pretty self-explanatory; there are
efficient collision attacks to generate keys with the same short id.

7. Consider [protecting
headers](https://github.com/autocrypt/protected-headers). By
default, only the email body is encrypted, not its headers.

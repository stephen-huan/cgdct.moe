# MyAnimeList Styling

[[style.scss]](./style.scss) [[output.css]](./output.css)

[MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) (MAL) lets the user upload
CSS to customize their user profile, for example, my profile is
[here](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/vazae). This can be done by
going to your list, clicking the gear icon and "Style Settings". From
there, clicking on a theme brings you to page where you can add custom CSS
as well as upload a cover or background image. Further settings can be
found by clicking on "List Settings" under the gear, which allows you to
do things like turn off images and choose which columns are shown.
